COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*FAD of Sdh1 is covalently attached at an active site His residue, 8alpha-N3-histidyl-FAD linkage, involving Arg582, required for enzyme activity. Flavinylation and assembly of succinate dehydrogenase are dependent on the C-terminal tail of the flavoprotein subunit. FAD binding is important to stabilize the Sdh1 conformation enabling association with Sdh2 and the membrane anchor subunits
