METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Cu2+	*	*2 mol of Cu per mol of enzyme
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Cu2+	*	*
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Iron	*	*when mitochondrial iron homeostasis is disrupted, iron accumulates in a reactive form and competes with manganese, inactivating the enzyme. The ability to control the iron pool within mitochondria is critical to maintaining enzyme activity
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Manganese	*	*
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Manganese	*	*mitochondrial localization is essential for insertion of manganese to protein. Insertion is only possible with a newly synthesized polypeptide and seems to be driven by the protein unfolding process associated with mitochondrial import
