COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	3-acetylpyridine-NAD+	*	*
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	NAD+	*	*activity with D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in presence of 0.0006-0.006 mM NAD+: activity of the monomeric form is negligible or absent, high activity of the tetramer. 0.02-0.06 mM NAD+: markedly higher catalytic activity of the monomer. 2 mM NAD+: specific activities of monomeric and tetrameric forms are similar and equal to 0.06 mM/min. Activity with 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate: activity of the monomer is considerably higher than that of the tetramer
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	NAD+	*	*weak binding of NAD+ to the enzyme
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	NAD+	*	*binding structure analysis: the NAD+ molecule inserts its pyrimidine ring into a narrow hydrophobic binding pocket on the positively charged surface of GAPDH3. The residues Asn7, Gly8, Phe9, Gly10, Asp33, Pro34, Phe35, The97, Gly98, and Phe100 tightly enclose the pyrimidine ring of NAD+. Because of a common adenine head, adenosine can also bind tightly to this hydrophobic binding pocket. There are two consecutive positively charged regions that contain an NAD+-binding site, one of which is located on each side of the tetramer
