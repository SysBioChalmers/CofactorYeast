METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Ca2+	*	*CaCl2 and MgCl2 are able to stabilize the enzyme at millimolar concentrations. Ca2+ stabilizes yeast ADH I by preventing the dissociation of the reduced form of the enzyme and by preventing the unfolding of the oxidized form of the enzyme. Ca2+ is fixed by the Asp236 and Glu101 side chains in yeast ADH I
