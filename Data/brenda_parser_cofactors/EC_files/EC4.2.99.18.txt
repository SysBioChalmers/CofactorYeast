METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*Mg2+ or Mn2+ required
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*optimal concentration: 2 mM (endonuclease D4); optimal concentration: 4 mM for endonuclease D1 and D2; optimal concentration: 6 mM, endonuclease E; optimal concentration: 8 mM, endonuclease D3; required
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mn2+	*	*Mn2+ or Mg2+ required
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Zn2+	*	*His83 coordinates one of three Zn2+ ions in Apn1's active site, structure comparisons. Structure of enzyme mutant H83A Apn1-substrate DNA complex with three Zn2+ ions containing Zn2+ ions per molecule of mutant enzyme, overview. Zn2+ ions are involved in catalysis
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Zn2+	*	*required for catalysis, molecular dynamics. The active site of H83A Apn1 contains only two Zn2+ ions, with their positions being changed versus a trinuclear Zn2+ cluster of wild-type Apn1
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	NaCl	*	*50 mM, 50% stimulation
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	NaCl	*	*150 mM, higher concentrations inhibit
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Iron	*	*Scr2 but not Scr1 is an iron-sulfur protein
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	more	*	*the nucleotide incision repair of the enzyme in presence of Mg2+ is unaltered, Mg2+ does not affect yeast Ape1 activity
