METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*binding of acetyl-CoA to the synthase is independent of Mg2+ but that of glyoxylate is strictly dependent on the presence of Mg2+
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*causes no structurel effects, suggesting the metal ion to be involved in enzymatic catalysis rather than structural alternations
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*Km: 0.5 mM; required
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mn2+	*	*can partially replace Mg2+ in activation
