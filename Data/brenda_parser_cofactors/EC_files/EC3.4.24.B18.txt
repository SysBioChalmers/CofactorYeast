COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	ATP	*	*ATP binding is required for enzyme assembly, enzyme contains conserved Walker-type ATPase domain of approximately 230 amino acids, dependent on; dependent on, enzyme contains an ATPase domain with a Walker-type P-loop typical for the AAA protease family, hydrolysis induces conformational changes of the AAA domain driving substrate unfolding and dislocation from the membrane
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	ATP	*	*dependent on, enzyme contains an ATPase domain with a Walker-type P-loop typical for the AAA protease family
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	ATP	*	*intersubunit coordination of the ATP hydrolysis leads to an ordered ATP hydrolysis within the AAA ring, which ensures efficient substrate dislocation from the membrane and translocation to the proteolytic chamber
