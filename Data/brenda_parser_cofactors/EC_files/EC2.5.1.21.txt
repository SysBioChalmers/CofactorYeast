METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*Mn2+ is more effective than Mg2+ in activation of dehydrosqualene formation; most effective in stimulation of squalene formation, half-maximal activity at 2.5 mM
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*Mn2+ is six times more effective in activation than Mg2+
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*Mn2+ is more effective than Mg2+ in activation of dehydrosqualene formation; required for squalene synthase reaction
