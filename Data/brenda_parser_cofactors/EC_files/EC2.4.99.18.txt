METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*divalent cation required. Mg2+, at concentration of 10 mM yields only one third the activity observed with Mn2+
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mg2+	*	*absolute requirement for divalent cations that can adopt an octahedral coordination geometry with preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Mn2+	*	*divalent cation required, 1 mM Mn2+ is optimal
