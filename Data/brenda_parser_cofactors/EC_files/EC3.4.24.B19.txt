COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	ATP	*	*ATP binding is not necessary for enzyme assembly, enzyme contains conserved Walker-type ATPase domain of approximately 230 amino acids, dependent on, hydrolysis induces conformational changes; dependent on, enzyme contains an ATPase domain with a Walker-type P-loop typical for the AAA protease family, hydrolysis induces conformational changes of the AAA domain driving substrate unfolding and dislocation from the membrane
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	ATP	*	*required, contains ATP-binding site spanning from residues 316 to 328, GVLLTGPPGTGKT
