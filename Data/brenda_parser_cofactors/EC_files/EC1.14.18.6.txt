COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome b5	*	*expression of the FAH1 cytochrome b5 domain in Escherichia coli produces a soluble protein that exhibits the typical oxidized versus reduced differential absorbance spectra of cytochrome b5
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome b5	*	*protein contains a cytochrome b5-like domain and a domain that resembles the family of cytochrome b5-dependent enzymes that use iron and oxygen to catalyse desaturation or hydroxylation of fatty acids
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome b5	*	*the enzyme contains a cytochrome b5 domain fused to the catalytic domain at the N terminus of the enzyme
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome b5	*	*a Cb5-like domain (Cb5LD)-containing protein
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Zn2+	*	*the enzyme contains two zinc atoms; the enzyme contains two zinc atoms coordinated by the side chains of 10 highly conserved histidines within a dimetal center located near the plane of the cytosolic membrane. The dimetal-binding site is located within the catalytic cap domain and is occupied by zinc atoms coordinated by the highly conserved histidine side chains from four histidine box motifs. Molecular dynamics simulations, allows modeling of a ceramide substrate below the dimetal center of scScs7p
