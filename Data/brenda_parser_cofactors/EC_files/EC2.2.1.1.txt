COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	thiamine diphosphate	*	*donor substrates (e.g. hydroxypyruvate or dihydroxyacetone) increase the affiniffty of the coenzyme for transketolase, whereas acceptor substrates do not. The effect of the substrate on the interaction of the coenzyme with apotransketolase and on stability of the reconstituted holoenzyme is caused by generation of 2-(alpha,beta-dihydroxyethyl)thiamine diphosphate (an intermediate product of the transketolase reaction), which has higher affinity for apotransketolase than thiamine diphosphate

COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	thiamine diphosphate	*	*in the presence of Ca2+, the active centers of transketolase differ in their affinity for thiamine diphosphate by approximately one order of magnitude. Hemiholotransketolase 1 is the enzyme in which the only functional active center is the one exhibiting higher affinity for thiamine diphosphate. When adding an equimolar amount of thiamine diphosphate to apotransketolase, it becomes completely bound to the 1 active center and is not dissociated from it in the course of subsequent experiments. Hemiholotransketolase 2 is the enzyme in which the only functional active center is the one exhibiting lower affinity for the coenzyme. In order to obtain this species of transketolase, active center 1, the affinity of which for thiamine diphosphate is higher, is to be blocked by an inactive analogue of the coenzyme, hydroxythiamine diphosphate
