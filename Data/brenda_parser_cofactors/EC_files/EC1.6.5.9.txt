COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*non-covalently linked
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*the mature enzyme contains FAD as prosthetic group
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*Ndi1 contains noncovalently bound FAD
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*binding site structure, overview. The isoalloxazine ring of the FAD is positioned between the two Rossmann domains, which define two channels along the interdomain plane that lead to the active site
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	more	*	*the enzyme contains no iron-sulfur clusters
