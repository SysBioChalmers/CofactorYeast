METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Cu	*	*4 atoms per protein
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Fe(II)	*	*wild-type, Km value 0.005 mM, mutant D283A, 0.019 mM, mutant E185A, 0.036 mM, mutant D409A, 0.019 mm, mutant E185A/D409A, 4 mM, respectively. The protein provides a binding site for Fe(II) that actually favors Fe(III), this coordination sphere places the bound Fe(II) in a state of entasis that can be relieved by loss of an electron. The EO of the bound Fe(II) is lowered relative to that of aqueous ferrous iron making electron transfer thermodynamically favorable. Carboxylates within this coordination sphere provide an electronic coupling pathway for the electron transfer via their H-bond network with type 1 Cu-histidine ligands thus making electron transfer kinetically efficient
