COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	pyridoxal 5'-phosphate	*	*reduction of the aldimine linkage tethering PLP to recombinant, tagged D-serine dehydratase by treatment with NaBH4 so as to yield an inactive form of the holoenzyme, DsdR, which is further treated with a protease in order to remove the amino-terminal purification tag. Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopic analysis reveals that both the reduced form DsdR and the reduced/detagged form DsdRD maintain the overall secondary structure of wild-type, but feature a significantly increased thermal stability. The observed Tm values for DsdR and for DsdRD shift to 71.5&deg;C and 73.3&deg;C, respectively, resulting in nearly 11&deg; and 13&deg; higher than the one measured for wild-type. Though catalytically inert, DsdRD retains the ability to enantioselectively bind its natural substrate
