COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome c	*	*holo CcP binds cytochrome c with micromolar affinity. For apo CcP, the interaction with cytochrome c is completely abolished
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome c	*	*thermodynamic affinity constants for binding the first and second cytochrome c are KI 0.0000001 per M, KII 0.0001 per M. Cytochrome c binds at the weaker-binding site with relatively great affinity, and places upper bounds on the contributions of repulsion between the two cytochrome c of the ternary complex
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	cytochrome c	*	*study on both chemical shift perturbations and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements effects in the NMR spectrum of CcP generated in the presence of spin-labelled cytochrome c
