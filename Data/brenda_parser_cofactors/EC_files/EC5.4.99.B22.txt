METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	KCl	*	*the complex of Pus1 with tRNA is sensitive to high ionic strength. The optimal concentration of KCl for Pus1 binding is 100 mM. Above 400 mM KCl, no complex is detected
METALSIONS	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Zinc	*	*contains one atom of zinc per 63000 Da monomer. This zinc ion could not be removed by treatment with EDTA or urea. However, a zinc-depleted enzyme is obtained after prolonged dialysis against the specific chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline. Removal of the zinc ion results in inactivation of the enzyme with concomitant loss of its ability to bind tRNA. Structural role for the zinc in the tRNA-pseudouridine synthetase Pus1
