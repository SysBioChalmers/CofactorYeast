COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*enzyme is linked to FAD
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*firmly attached but nut covalently linked to the protein; one molecule of FAD per subunit
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*dependent on, N-terminal cysteine pair contributes to the correct arrangement of the FAD-binding fold
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*dependent on
COFACTOR	Saccharomyces cerevisiae	FAD	*	*dithionite and photochemical reductions of Erv2p show full reduction of the flavin cofactor after the addition of 4 electrons with a midpoint potential of -200 mV at pH 7.5. No charge-transfer complex between a proximal thiolate and the oxidized flavin
