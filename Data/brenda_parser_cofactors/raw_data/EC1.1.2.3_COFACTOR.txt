The flavin binding domain contains a parallel beta8alpha8 barrel structure and is composed of residues 100 to 486. The FMN moiety, which is located at the C-terminal end of the central beta-barrel, is mostly sequestered from solvent. It forms hydrogen bond interactions with main- and side-chain atoms from six of the eight beta-strands. The interaction of Lys349 with atoms N-1 and O-2 of the flavin ring is probably responsible for stabilization of the anionic form of the flavin semiquinone and hydroquinone and enhancing the reactivity of atom N-5 toward sulfite. The binding of pyruvate at the active site in subunit 2 is stabilized by interaction of its carboxylate group with the side-chain atoms of Arg376 and Tyr143. Residues His373 and Tyr254 interact with the keto-oxygen atom and are involved in catalysis. In contrast, four water molecules occupy the substrate-binding site in subunit 1 and Tyr143 forms a hydrogen bond to the ordered heme propionate group.
