This zinc ion could not be removed by treatment with EDTA or urea. However, a zinc-depleted enzyme is obtained after prolonged dialysis against the specific chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline. Removal of the zinc ion results in inactivation of the enzyme with concomitant loss of its ability to bind tRNA.
