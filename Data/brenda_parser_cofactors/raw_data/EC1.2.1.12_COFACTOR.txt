The residues Asn7, Gly8, Phe9, Gly10, Asp33, Pro34, Phe35, The97, Gly98, and Phe100 tightly enclose the pyrimidine ring of NAD+. Because of a common adenine head, adenosine can also bind tightly to this hydrophobic binding pocket. There are two consecutive positively charged regions that contain an NAD+-binding site, one of which is located on each side of the tetramer#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*7#literature*742717#!ecNumber*1.2.1.12#cofactor*NAD+#commentary*#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*7#literature*287899, 287943, 287948, 287952, 287954, 287967, 287975, 288344, 689409, 743567#!ecNumber*1.2.1.12#cofactor*NADH#commentary*cofactor#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*8#literature*287899, 287931, 287937#
