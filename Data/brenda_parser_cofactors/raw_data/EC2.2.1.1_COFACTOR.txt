The effect of the substrate on the interaction of the coenzyme with apotransketolase and on stability of the reconstituted holoenzyme is caused by generation of 2-(alpha,beta-dihydroxyethyl)thiamine diphosphate (an intermediate product of the transketolase reaction), which has higher affinity for apotransketolase than thiamine diphosphate#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*91#literature*672281#!ecNumber*2.2.1.1#cofactor*thiamine diphosphate#commentary*theoretical analysis of interaction between thiamine diphosphate-binding sites of transketolase and determination of equilibrium and kinetic constants of individual stages of the interaction between thiamine diphosphate and the apoenzyme in the presence of Ca2+#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*91#literature*672288#!ecNumber*2.2.1.1#cofactor*thiamine diphosphate#commentary*application of a theoretical model of interactions between ligand-binding sites in a dimeric protein for the analysis of thiamine diphosphate binding to yeast transketolase#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*91#literature*672632#!ecNumber*2.2.1.1#cofactor*thiamine diphosphate#commentary*interaction with the coenzyme binding site of the enzyme is described#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*91#literature*674081#!ecNumber*2.2.1.1#cofactor*thiamine diphosphate#commentary*thiamine diphosphate increases the stability of the apoenzyme regardless of wether Mg2+ or Ca2+ is present in the medium#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*91#literature*675747#!ecNumber*2.2.1.1#cofactor*thiamine diphosphate#commentary*in the presence of Ca2+, the active centers of transketolase differ in their affinity for thiamine diphosphate by approximately one order of magnitude. Hemiholotransketolase 1 is the enzyme in which the only functional active center is the one exhibiting higher affinity for thiamine diphosphate. When adding an equimolar amount of thiamine diphosphate to apotransketolase, it becomes completely bound to the 1 active center and is not dissociated from it in the course of subsequent experiments. Hemiholotransketolase 2 is the enzyme in which the only functional active center is the one exhibiting lower affinity for the coenzyme. In order to obtain this species of transketolase, active center 1, the affinity of which for thiamine diphosphate is higher, is to be blocked by an inactive analogue of the coenzyme, hydroxythiamine diphosphate#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*91#literature*690697#!ecNumber*2.2.1.1#cofactor*thiamine diphosphate#commentary*two-step mechanism of interaction of thiamine diphosphate with transketolase.
