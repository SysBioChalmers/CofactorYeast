Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopic analysis reveals that both the reduced form DsdR and the reduced/detagged form DsdRD maintain the overall secondary structure of wild-type, but feature a significantly increased thermal stability. The observed Tm values for DsdR and for DsdRD shift to 71.5&deg;C and 73.3&deg;C, respectively, resulting in nearly 11&deg; and 13&deg; higher than the one measured for wild-type. Though catalytically inert, DsdRD retains the ability to enantioselectively bind its natural substrate#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*32#literature*714380#!ecNumber*4.3.1.18#cofactor*pyridoxal 5'-phosphate#commentary*#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*32#literature*729705, 729953, 730889#!ecNumber*4.3.1.18#cofactor*pyridoxal 5'-phosphate#commentary*dependent on#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*32#literature*748453#
