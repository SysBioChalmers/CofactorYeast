Minimal activity under optimal conditions and an increase in HMGR activities and protein levels under hyposaline and hypersaline conditions. HMGR activity is crucial for halotolerance as well as for the changes in protein prenylation in response to changing salinity#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*42#literature*701255#
