ecNumber*2.1.1.201#cofactor*NADH#commentary*NAFH is required form optimal activity in in vitro assay with mitochondrial lysate. It is likely that the function of NADH is the reduction of the oxidized 2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinone substrate to the hydroquinone form (2-methoxy-6-polyprenyl-1,4-benzoquinol), which presumably acts as the methyl acceptor#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*8#literature*704388#!ecNumber*2.1.1.201#cofactor*S-adenosyl-L-methionine#commentary*#organism*Saccharomyces cerevisiae#ligandStructureId*24#literature*735364#
