SA	Escherichia coli	-999	*	*thiamine triphoshate accumulation in response to amino acid starvation, controverse mechanism of synthesis dicussed, adenylate kinase-independent accumulation of thiamine triphosphate, heat-sensitive CV2 strain of Escherichia coli accumulates thiamine triphosphate despite full inactivation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent decrease of cellular ATP, ATP-dependent mechanisms for thiamine triphosphate synthesis not favoured since large accumulation also observed during energy stress where ATP is low
